# Perceptual hash demo

This directory contains a demonstration of the perceptual hash functionality
used by Reddit Deduplicator to detect duplicate thumbnails.

To use the demo, select one or more image files to open using the file chooser.
The images will be added to the table along with visualizations of the
perceptual hash functions.

To compare hash values, select an image by clicking a radio button in the
"Compare" column. The other rows will be updated to compare their hash values
with the selected row. To clear comparison information, click the radio button
in the header row.
